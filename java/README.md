## Requirements

* Tableau Server, or an account on Tableau Cloud
* Java SDK
  * Download: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>
* Apache Ant
  * It is not neccessary to run the "Optional" steps in the Apache Ant guide.
  * Download: <http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html>
* Apache Ivy
  * Download: <http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi>
  * For installation instructions, see the readme file included in the download.

## Getting started

1. Install the tools listed in the "Requirements" section.
   1. Make sure that Tableau Server is running if you are using your own server.
1. In the /res folder, open the config.properties file using a text editor.
   1. Modify the configurations as instructed in the file. 
   2. A sample workbook is already provided with this sample, but you can use any packaged workbook that you want.
   
1. Download the REST API schema and save it in the `/res` folder under the folder where this README file is. For more information about the schema, see the following documentation:

   <http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/help.htm#REST/rest_api_concepts_schema.htm>

1. In the `/res` folder, open the `config.properties` file using a text editor.
1. Modify the configurations as instructed in the file. A sample workbook is already provided with this sample, but you can use any packaged workbook that you want.
1. Open the following file in a text editor:

   ```
   src\com\tableausoftware\documentation\api\rest\util\RestApiUtils.java
   ```

1. Find the `getApiUriBuilder()` method, and replace the API URL with the correct version number.

   For example, you might see the following URL:

   ```
   /api/3.5/
   ```

   If you want to use version 3.4 of the API, replace the URL with the following:

   ```
   /api/3.4/
   ```

## Running the sample

1. Make sure that Tableau Server is running.
1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
   1. In the command prompt window, change directory to the sample code's parent folder.
   1. Enter `ant` in the command prompt to compile the sample code and download dependencies.
   1. Enter `ant run` in the command prompt to run the sample code after compilation.

## Possible problems

When `ant` is run in a command prompt, it may respond with "ant is not recognized as an internal or external command..."

Make sure that the `ANT_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` variables are set as described in the installation guide for Apache Ant. Paths should not include quotes.
For more information, see <http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html#windows>

The example code uses version 3.0 of the REST API and schema. If you want to use a different version:
1. Download the REST API schema and save it in the `/res` folder under the folder where this README file is. For more information about the schema, see the following documentation:

   <http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/help.htm#REST/rest_api_concepts_schema.htm>

1. In the `/res` folder, open the `config.properties` file using a text editor.
1. Update the schema configuration properties to match the new file.
