# rest-api-samples
This repository contains Python and Java samples for the Tableau REST API, as well as [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/) that can be called against the REST API. For instructions on running the samples, see the Readme files in each directory.

Official developer docs for the REST API can be found [here](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/help.htm).

Getting Started
---------------

* Clone this repository.
* Select the version of the REST API that you want to use. The API version corresponds to the version of Tableau Server that you use.
  For more information, see [API Versions in the documentation](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/help.htm#REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm). You will have to configure the samples to use the API version that you select.
* Try the samples against your Tableau Server or Tableau Online.
* Use 'Issues' to note any bugs or to request new samples.
* Let us know if you have samples of your own you'd like to share.
