This repository contains Python and Java samples for the Tableau REST API, as well as [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/) that can be called against the REST API. For instructions on running the samples, see the Readme files in each directory.

Getting Started
---------------

* Clone this repository.
* Select the version of the REST API that you want to use. The API version corresponds to the version of Tableau Server that you use.
  For more information, see [API Versions in the documentation](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/help.htm#REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm). You will have to configure the samples to use the API version that you select.
* Try the samples against your Tableau Server or Tableau Online.
* Use 'Issues' to note any bugs or to request new samples.
* Let us know if you have samples of your own you'd like to share.

Note: the Java samples are written for Java 8, and will not run against Java 11 or Java 13. We do plan to update them, but if you send a PR that would also be welome!
